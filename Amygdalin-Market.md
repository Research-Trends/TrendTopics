Amygdalin, often derived from apricot kernels, is largely recognized for its controversial role in alternative medicine and its potential applications in treating various health conditions. The global market size was valued at approximately $200 million in 2023 and is projected to witness a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of around 8% from 2024 to 2032. This growth is primarily fueled by rising consumer interest in natural and organic products, alongside a growing demand for dietary supplements. </p> <p> Forecasts indicate that by 2024, the amygdalin market could reach about $216 million. Over the following years, it is expected to climb significantly, reaching an estimated $300 million by 2032. This upward trend is anticipated as more individuals turn towards alternative therapies for health management, and as more research continues to shed light on the benefits of amygdalin. Additionally, the increase in disposable incomes and health-conscious lifestyles across various demographics are expected to propel market growth. </p> <p> **** Continued developments in extraction and processing technologies are likely to enhance the yield and purity of amygdalin, making it more appealing for various applications, including the nutraceutical and pharmaceutical sectors. Furthermore, as regulatory frameworks evolve to accommodate natural compounds, amygdalin could see broader acceptance and utilization within healthcare practitioners' circles. </p> <p> Analysts predict that regions with high agricultural output of sources of amygdalin, including stone fruits, will play a critical role in the supply chain dynamics.
