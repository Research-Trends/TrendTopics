The global demand for both manual and electric wheelchairs is surging, primarily fueled by technological advancements, which have made wheelchairs more user-friendly and accessible. According to market research, the global wheelchairs market was valued at approximately <strong>$8 billion</strong> in 2023 and is projected to exhibit a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of <strong>6.5%</strong> from 2024 to 2032.</p><p>In terms of market size, projections indicate a robust expansion, with the market anticipated to reach around <strong>$12 billion</strong> by 2032. The development of innovative products offering enhanced functionalities such as smart wheelchairs, which incorporate IoT and AI technologies, has become a key factor in driving market growth. Additionally, rising awareness about mobility solutions for healthcare facilities is contributing to the growing adoption of wheelchairs.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p>Furthermore, the increase in healthcare spending, especially in emerging economies coupled with government initiatives aimed at improving healthcare access for the elderly and disabled populations, serves as a significant growth driver. The electric wheelchair segment is projected to witness higher growth rates during this period, primarily due to their ease of use, enhanced maneuverability, and improved battery life. The growing trend towards customized wheelchairs is also anticipated to boost market growth, as consumers seek personalized solutions that meet their specific needs.</p><p>According to forecasts, the market for manual wheelchairs will maintain a strong presence but is expected to grow at a slower pace compared to electric wheelchairs. By 2032, the electric wheelchair segment is expected to account for more than <strong>65%</strong> of the overall market share.
