With the rising demand for high-protein animal feed, particularly in the livestock and aquaculture industries, the market is expected to expand further. In 2024, the market size is projected to reach approximately <strong>$7 billion</strong>. Factors contributing to this growth include increasing livestock production globally, coupled with the escalating need for sustainable and high-quality feed alternatives.</p> <p>Furthermore, the livestock cake market is anticipated to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of around <strong>5.5%</strong> from 2024 to 2032.
